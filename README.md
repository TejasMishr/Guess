# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in C++. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The user is provided with feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. The program keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user and displays it at the end.

## Instructions

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
4. Enter your guess for the number when prompted.
5. If your guess is lower than the generated number, the program will display "GO high".
6. If your guess is higher than the generated number, the program will display "GO low".
7. If your guess matches the generated number, the program will display "Congratulations!!" and "You guessed it right."
8. The program will display the number of attempts you made to guess the number.
